<h3>About Burst-Core.js</h3>

<h4>What does Burst-Core do?</h4>
<p>Burst-Core.js delivers powerful time-line animation features in a sugary
JavaScript shell. With Burst-Core you can build complex animations on the Web
using a comprehensive set of simple commands. Burst-Core is designed to suit
highly-complex, multi-layered, non-linear and functional animations.</p>

<h4>Classic Animation Architecture</h4>
<p>
Burst-Core is based on a simple classic animation structure:
<pre>
Time-line > Object > Track > Key-frame > Property
</pre>
</p>

<p>When you use Burst-Core, you create one or more Timelines. Timelines contain
Objects. An Object is a JavaScript object, that contains the member-variables
you wish to animate. For example: if you were making a game, you might want your
main-character to be a game-sprite. Thus you would create a JavaScript object
to contain your game-sprite.</p>

<pre>
myGameSprite = {
  x       : 100,
  y       : 100,
  action  : 'walk',
  draw    : function(){ ...
};
</pre>

<p>Once you have added an Objects to the Timeline, you will want to animate the
Object's properties (member-variables). You do this by creating Tracks. A Track
is like a Timeline, except it contains Keys instead of Objects. The Track refers
to the specific property or "member-variable" of the Object you are animating.
</p>

<p>Every Key that you add to the property track, contains the values of each
property you wish to animate. For example: you might want to animate the left
property of your game-sprite as it walks across the screen.</p>

<p>To do this you would require 2 Keys. The first Key for the start-frame of the
animation, with a left-property of 100 and another Key for the end-frame,
telling Burst-Core to set the left-property to 200.</p>

<p>The global Burst object is then used to control the animation of your
Timeline. All the values for the frames in-between the Keys are calculated with
easing values and callback functions for complex animations that can be
reconfigured at run-time.  </p>

<h4>Example of Syntax</h4>

<pre>
// Timeline args: timelineName, startFrame, endFrame, speedRatio, loop, callBack 
burst.timeline( 'myTimeline', 0, 100, 1, false, function(){ alert('finished!'); } )

  // Object args: name, objectReference
  .obj( 'myDiv', document.getElementById( 'myDiv' ).style )    

    // Track args: property to change over time
    .track( 'left' )

      // Key args: frameNumber, valueAtFrame, easeingMethod
      .key(   0,   0, 'outBounce' )
      .key( 100, 100 );
</pre>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>Burst-Core started life named "The Burst Engine". The Burst Engine was an
SVG-to-Canvas rendering project I created for making simple cartoons with SVG
and JavaScript. The Burst Engine started back in 2008 before SVGs were
cross-browser, and was a method to "plug-the-gap" that the lack of SVG support.
</p>

<p>A couple of years on, and SVG features have now rolled out, even as far as
Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. At this stage in the Web's evolution, I no longer
see a long-term need for a tool that renders SVG elements to the Canvas.</p>

<p>The time-line features of the Burst Engine however, are the quintisential
core features of any animation library. I also came to love the rapidity of the
chaining syntax offered by The Burst Engine, and wanted to capture that magic in
a light-weight JavaScript library.</p>

<p>The Burst Engine died, Burst-Core was born.</p>
